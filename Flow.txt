Python Flow Control
Conditionals
Control the flow of a programIf … else
We use if … else statement to control the flow of the our program . When we need
a decision based on a condition .
Basic Syntax :
If test_expression:
Statement / sIf … else
We can add body of code to execute in case the expression is false in the if
statement.
Syntax :
If test_expression:
Statement / s
else:
Statement / sIf … elif … else
We can also check multiple expressions , and execute the body of code inside
them when the expression evaluate to true. We use elif , which is a short for else
if.
Syntax:
If test_expression:
Statement / s
elif test_expression:
Statement / s
else:
Statement / sComparison Operators
> Greater than: True if the left operand is greater than the right
< Less than: True if the left operand is less than the right
== Equal to: True if both operands are equal
!= Not equal to – True if operands are not equal
>= Greater than or equal to: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right
<= Less than or equal to: True if left operand is less than or equal to the rightLogical Operators
and Logical AND: True if both the operands are true
or Logical OR: True if either of the operands is true
not Logical NOT: True if operand is false
